# Crashworthiness Processing
IIHS Crashworthiness tests are processed using the scripts that are contained within this repository.
    Moderate/Small overlap scripts are contained within the "Frontal" sub-folder
    Side impact scripts are contained within the "Side" sub-folder
    Rear impact sled scripts are contained within the "Rear" sub-folder

To get started, run CrashStartup.VBS. The directory structure of this repository must be maintained in order for these scripts to run.

## Modifications Needed to Run Scripts
    Paths to raw data will need to be modified.
    Paths to save directories will need to be modified.
    All channels collected from ATDs will need to follow the IIHS naming convention.
